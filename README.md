# ADHD-Friendly Action-First Second Brain

## Overview
This system helps ADHD users engage with routines, tasks, and actions without guilt, focusing on *doing* rather than planning.

## Core Ideas
- Actions are the only executable unit
- Routines generate actions once per cadence
- Tasks are fulfilled via actions
- Projects organize tasks
- Missing days do not backfill actions
- Engagement > completion

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Nest.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Clerk
- Serverless preferred for MVP

## Status
Early design & implementation. Fully functional without AI.
