# ADHD-Friendly Action-First Second Brain - Pitch

**Problem:**
People with ADHD struggle with initiation, focus, context switching, motivation, and overwhelm. Most productivity systems assume linear planning, stable motivation, and reward through completion, which often leads to guilt and abandonment.

**Solution:**
An action-first second brain focused on **small, immediate actions** derived from routines, tasks, and projects, where engagement matters more than completion. The system is usable **without AI** and avoids punishment for inconsistency.
